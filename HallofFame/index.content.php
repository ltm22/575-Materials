<h2>Welcome to the ANLY/DSAN 575 Data Website of Leonard Marshall.</h2>

<H3>Please explore this website as to investigate a few trends related to MLB Hall of Fame Candidate performance and balloting from 2018-2020.</H3>

<H4>In order to qualify for the ballot, a player must achieve ten years of tenure in the league, must be retired for at least five years, and a screening committee must approve the player's worthiness.</H4>
<H5>Once on the ballot, the player must maintain at least 5% of the votes in order to remain on the ballot into the following year. If a player achieves 75% of votes or more, they are officially inducted into the Hall of Fame. If, after 15 years, a player has not reached 75% of the votes, they will not be elected into the Hall of Fame via this traditional approach.</H5>

<p>The first two tabs on this site ('Players', 'Position Charts') are merely provided as reference tables that other pages pull from.</h4>
 On the 'Hitting Stats' page, all common statistics for players (other than pitchers) are shared, and a visualization is displayed comparing career steal totals against career homerun totals.
 On the 'Pitching Stats' page, all common statistics for pitchers are shared, and a visualization is displayed comparing career innings pitched against career strikeouts thrown.
 On the 'Career Stats' page, more advanced metrics are shared. The data visualization toward the bottom of this page displays the average Wins Above Replacement (WAR) that a nominated player generated throughout his career.
 Finally, the 'Most Recent Balloting' page shares details about the results of the final ballot the player has appeared on. At the bottom of this page, one can find a simple pie chart showing the number of players nominated in the last three years, by position.</p>
